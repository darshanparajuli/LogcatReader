ABOUT US (LOGCATREADER)

# What is Logcatreader
Logcatreader is an android app tool that allows access to messages from applications and services running on an Android device. Most Android developers depend heavily on log-cat (and adb) during development to debug their applications. 
Logcatreader merges different logging information available from different Android subsystems.
This app was developed to help simplify the processes involved for developers and app testers in getting android log information.
In logcatreader we have added the following into the provided log details: 

#### 1 Priority (this indicates the severity of a log message), which are:

* Verbose, 
* Debug,
* Info, 
* Warning, 
* Error and,
* Assert

#### 2 Tag

 This identifies  the software component that generated the message, which is being used to filter messages.

#### 3 The actual message

A new line character is added to the end of every messages.

#### Importance of Logcat

* Helps developers while crerating new apps
* Helps in testing of new apps to gather necessary information.
* Helps developers in fixing problems on their apps.
